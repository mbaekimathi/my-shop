# MY-SHOP — project notes

## Stack
Django 5 app: `employees` (portal + HR), `shops` (shop floor/POS), `items` (stock),
`pos`, `communications`. Templates in `templates/`, JS in `static/js/`.

## Database
- `MYSQL_ENABLED=True` (default) expects MariaDB/MySQL on 127.0.0.1:3306 (XAMPP).
  Start it with: `"C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe" --defaults-file="C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini"`
- `MYSQL_ENABLED=False` falls back to `db.sqlite3`, but some migrations use
  MySQL-only SQL (`AUTO_INCREMENT`, `ENUM`) — the full test suite requires MySQL.

## Tests
```bash
python manage.py test shops.tests -v 1
```
Session-related suites: `test_single_session`, `test_portal_session_exclusivity`,
`test_shop_portal_session`, `test_switch_login_tmp`.

## Auth model
- Two independent session types per browser: employee (Django auth) and shop
  portal (`shop_portal_auth` + `shop_portal_shop_id` session keys).
- **Employee and shop portal sessions are concurrent**: many devices/tabs may
  stay signed in at once. `EmployeeProfile.active_session_key` and
  `Shop.active_session_key` only record the most recent sign-in for diagnostics
  (stamped at login / `bind_shop_portal_session`, migrated on session-key
  rotation); they are not enforced. A newer login must not sign out older
  sessions.
- Session-key rotation is bridged by `RotatedSessionMiddleware` (old key →
  pointer → new key, 120s grace) so in-flight tabs survive login rotations.
- Note: one browser profile still shares one Django session cookie, so two
  *different* employee accounts cannot be signed in in the same browser profile
  at once — use separate browsers/profiles for that.
- **HR Management is permission-gated, not role-gated**: any active employee may
  open `/<role>/hr-management/` pages when the matching toggle under
  `hr-management` in the permissions matrix (`…/hr-management/permissions/`) is
  enabled (`employee_may` / `require_module_permission`). Approving registrations
  requires `hr-management/approvals`. Non-super-admin actors may only update
  employees still `pending_approval`, may not assign the Super Admin role, and
  may not modify Super Admin accounts (edit/suspend/delete). The same rules are
  enforced for queued offline syncs in `sync_handlers._sync_update_employee_access`.
